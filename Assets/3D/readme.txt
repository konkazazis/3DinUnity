Thanks for buying the model from me !
Please credits me if you end up using them!

Be aware that i'm using a uv method called UDIM so i sadly couldn't pack the textures in the blend you will have to retarget the body textures,
everything is correctly labeled so you shouldn't have much trouble doing so


Other thing to be aware of :

-The lenses are animatable just have to click on the frame and go into the mesh tab to find a shape key for them !
